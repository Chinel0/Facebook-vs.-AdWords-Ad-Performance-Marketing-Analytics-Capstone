## 🌟 Project Summary (STAR Method)

**S - Situation:**  
Our team was given a 2023 marketing dataset comparing Facebook and AdWords ad campaigns. The business question was: _Which platform delivers more conversions and why?_

**T - Task:**  
As a Marketing Analyst, I was tasked with using statistical techniques to evaluate ad performance and generate insights that could guide future marketing decisions.

**A - Action:**  
I used Excel to calculate measures of central tendency and spread, visualize relationships with charts, perform hypothesis testing, and run a linear regression model. I presented these insights visually in a PowerPoint deck.

**R - Result:**  
I found that Facebook Ads consistently yielded higher conversions and a stronger correlation between clicks and conversions. The regression model projected conversion outcomes based on ad click volume, allowing for better future planning.

## 🎯 Project Objectives <a name="objectives"></a>
Compare clicks vs. conversions for both platforms

Use descriptive statistics to summarize campaign performance

Identify correlations between ad interactions and conversions

Test for statistically significant differences using hypothesis testing

Build a simple regression model to predict conversions

---

## 🧪 Methodology <a name="methodology"></a>
✔️ Descriptive Statistics:

Mean, median, mode, and standard deviation of clicks and conversions

Frequency distribution and histograms to check for normality

✔️ Variable Classification:

Determined variable types (Quantitative, Continuous, Dependent/Independent)

✔️ Hypothesis Testing:

Conducted a two-sample t-test to assess conversion differences

Defined null and alternative hypotheses

✔️ Regression Modeling:

Built a simple linear regression in Excel to predict conversions from clicks

Evaluated model with R² and p-values

✔️ Data Visualization:

Created scatter plots, frequency tables, histograms, and correlation charts

Designed PowerPoint visuals to support business storytelling

## 📊 Key Analytical Steps & Visualizations

### 1. 🧮 Measures of Central Tendency
- **Charts Used:** Summary Table
- **Insights:**
  - Mean Clicks: 44 | Median: 43 | Mode: 36  
  - Mean Conversions: 11 | Median: 12 | Mode: 13  
  These statistics show a relatively symmetric distribution, giving us a reliable center point for both clicks and conversions.

---

### 2. 📈 Measures of Spread
- **Charts Used:** Standard Deviation Summary
- **Standard Deviations:**
  - Clicks: 12.14  
  - Conversions: 2.92  
- **Impact:**  
  This low spread in conversion data suggests more consistent performance, making Facebook Ads a predictable option.

---

### 3. 📊 Frequency Table
- **Chart Type:** Bar Chart
- **Insight:**  
  By categorizing conversions (e.g. <6, 6–10, 11–15, >15), I observed that most days fall into the 6–15 conversions range, confirming mid-level daily performance.

---

### 4. 📉 Scatter Plot + Correlation Coefficient
- **Correlation Coefficient:** **0.86**  
- **Chart Type:** Scatter Plot with Trendline  
- **Insight:**  
  A very strong positive relationship between Facebook Ad Clicks and Conversions suggests that increased ad clicks significantly influence conversions.

---

### 5. 🧪 Hypothesis Testing (T-Test)
- **Hypothesis:** Facebook Ads will result in higher conversions than AdWords.
- **Result:** P-value < 0.05 → Statistically significant  
- **Conclusion:** Facebook outperforms AdWords in conversion rates with statistical confidence.

---

### 6. 📉 Simple Linear Regression Model
- **Chart Used:** Regression Line Chart  
- **Model:**  
  - **Equation:** Conversions = 0.31 × Clicks + 0.34  
  - **R² Value:** 0.77  
- **Insight:**  
  This model predicts that every 10 additional Facebook clicks yield ~3 more conversions. This is a strong case for scaling Facebook Ads.
